# SMS Voting Campaigns

My solution to the following task:

Create a rails application to show the results for TV SMS voting campaigns,
derived from log data held in a text file. Deliverables:

* Rails app and database to hold the data
* Basic web front tend to view list of campaigns and their results
* Command line script that will import the log file data into the application
* Description of my approach - see below

Usage
---------
To use make sure that you first have Rails and Postgres installed.
```
$
```

```
$ bin/rake votes:import\["/Users/chriscooper/Desktop/votes_short.txt"\]
```
